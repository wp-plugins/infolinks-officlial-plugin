= What ad products does Infolinks offer? =

Infolinks offers a variety of ad solutions to monetize websites of all levels. 

InFold – InFold takes advantage of the power of search and display, delivering ads on a wider scale of traffic. This clever ad unit appears in a unique, stationary location right above the fold.

InText – Double underline your best keywords to monetize your written content. A simple hover of a mouse opens an ad bubble containing an ad matched to the context of your keywords. Fully customize the look and volume of InText ads on your website pages.

InFrame – Attractive skyscraper display banners placed in the extra real estate in the margins of wide screen monitors only. These ads are matched to your website’s category and are intelligently revealed only on traffic originating from wide screen monitors and customized to fit perfectly, without disturbing your site’s layout at all.
